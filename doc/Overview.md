> one line description ‚Üê What issue does this module solve?

 This is implemented that accept vesting token and wallet owner set and manage only one vesting schedule. In addition, this VestingWallet connect to ERC20 contract.

## Features

- ContractOwner can set vesting token address.(It can be any ERC20 token)
- ContractOwner can create vesting schedule by setting beneficiary address, starttime and duration time.
- ContractOwner can revoke current vesting schedule which is set on contract.
- ContractOwner can release current releasable amount of vesting tokens to beneficiary address.


## Use case

Using VestingWalletModule, users can create their own vesting schedule. Ofc, it's different way that claim rewards by staking, but it can be helpful for keep token price and something like that. For now, I think it can be used for two purposes. One is keeping token price and other is paying to devs.
